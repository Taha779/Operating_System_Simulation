Project Overview
This project is a console-based simulation of an operating system, designed to demonstrate key concepts in process and file management. The application allows users to interact with a simulated operating system environment, where they can manage processes and files through a user-friendly command-line interface.

Features
Process Management:

Create, destroy, suspend, resume, block, and wake up processes.
Change process priority and dispatch processes for execution.
Supports various scheduling algorithms including:
First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
Shortest Job First (SJF)
Round Robin (RR)
Non-Preemptive and Preemptive Priority Scheduling
Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
Displays detailed information about each process, including ID, arrival time, burst time, status, and priority.
File Management:

Create and delete files and directories.
Write to and read from files.
Move files between directories.
Manage file permissions and view contents of directories.
User Interface:

A simple text-based menu system for easy navigation.
Input validation to ensure correct data entry.
Technologies Used
Java programming language
Java Collections Framework for data management
Console-based user interface
