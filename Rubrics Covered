The covered rubrics in the Java operating system project code typically include criteria for evaluating process management, file management, 
user interface design, and overall functionality. Key aspects may involve the implementation of scheduling algorithms, code efficiency, 
user interaction, and error handling. For detailed rubrics, you may refer to specific grading documents or assessment rubrics available online.

- **Process Management Evaluation**:
  - Ability to create, destroy, suspend, and resume processes.
  - Implementation of various scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, etc.).
  - Correct handling of process states (Ready, Running, Blocked, Suspended).
  - Efficiency in managing process priorities and execution.

  
- **File Management Evaluation**:
  - Functionality to create, delete, and manage files and directories.
  - Capability to read from and write to files.
  - Proper handling of file permissions and directory navigation.
  - Implementation of file movement between directories.

  
- **User  Interface Design**:
  - Clarity and usability of the command-line interface.
  - Effectiveness of the menu system for navigation.
  - Input validation and error handling to enhance user experience.

  
- **Code Quality and Efficiency**:
  - Adherence to coding standards and best practices.
  - Use of appropriate data structures (e.g., ArrayList, HashMap).
  - Overall code organization and modularity for maintainability.

  
- **Functionality and Performance**:
  - Correctness of the implemented features and algorithms.
  - Performance metrics such as execution time and resource utilization.
  - Robustness of the application under various input scenarios.

  
- **Documentation and Comments**:
  - Clarity and completeness of code comments.
  - Quality of project documentation, including setup instructions and usage guidelines.
  - Inclusion of a README file that outlines project objectives and features.
